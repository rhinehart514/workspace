      STATUS: December 2025 — actively building, can code, shipping projects.

      PANASCI 2025 RESULT:
      - Semifinalist (13 of 41), didn't place in finals
      - SATE (AI speech analysis) won first place
      - Not a failure — competition validated the pivot, didn't win prize money

      HIVE AS AI BUILDER:
      - "Zapier/Retool for campus orgs" is the thesis
      - Can they ship fast enough to matter?
      - University market is slow but sticky if you get in

      WHAT MATTERS NOW (Dec 2025):
      1. What are you building RIGHT NOW?
      2. Is HIVE the focus or something new?
      3. Revenue status — any paying customers yet?
      4. What's the stack? What can you ship in a weekend?

      BUILDER ASSESSMENT:
      - Can code = can ship fast
      - Small team with technical skills = dangerous in a good way
      - Question: Are you building for the market or building what's interesting?

      OPPORTUNITIES:
      - Local Buffalo businesses need AI ops (brain's idea.001)
      - HIVE AI builder could pivot to broader SMB market
      - Framer + AI automation = productized service potential

    future_proof_score: 7/10  # UPGRADED — AI builder ages better than social platform

      STATUS: December 2025 — builder, can code, shipping projects.

      SKILLS STACK:
      - Framer (expert) + Python + Data Analytics + Web Dev
      - This is a BUILDER, not just a business guy
      - Can ship software, not just pitch decks

      WHAT'S WORKING:
      - OWSH Unlimited = real business with real clients
      - Free build → monthly recurring is SMART acquisition model
      - Framer expertise = differentiated, fast shipping
      - Can add AI layer to services (has the technical chops)

      DECEMBER 2025 QUESTIONS:
      1. What are you building NOW?
      2. Is OWSH still active? What's the MRR?
      3. What's the tech stack you're most productive in?
      4. HIVE or something new — where's the energy?

      BUILDER OPPORTUNITIES:
      - AI-powered local business tools (automate the manual stuff)
      - Framer templates + AI = productized offering
      - Data analytics dashboards for SMBs
      - Review response automation
      - Content generation for local businesses

      SCALE PATHS:
      1. Productize OWSH — templates + playbooks as products
      2. Niche vertical — "AI ops for contractors" or restaurants
      3. Build once, sell many — software > services
      4. Combine with Jacob's platform skills for infrastructure play

      COLLABORATION:
      - Two builders who can code = ship fast together
      - Buffalo market knowledge + technical skills = local moat
      - Question: what's the fastest path to $10k MRR together?
