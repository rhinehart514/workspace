      Jacob has hustle but may be chasing the wrong target with HIVE.

      HIVE PROBLEM: Student platforms are a graveyard. Universities are slow buyers.
      Students churn every 4 years. Monetization is brutal (students have no money,
      universities have no budget). This is a "sounds good, makes no money" trap.

      BETTER PLAY: Obito Digital or a joint local business play.
      His marketing skills + platform ambition could be redirected to:
      - Local business SaaS (not students — businesses that pay)
      - Agency-to-productized-service transition
      - Buffalo B2B market where relationships actually close deals

      PUSH HIM ON: "How does HIVE make money? Who has paid you?"
      If no answer → kill HIVE, double down on Obito or new venture.

    future_proof_score: 5/10  # HIVE concept could be AI-disrupted; pure platform play is 2020 thinking

      Noah is closer to the money. OWSH Unlimited is a real business.

      WHAT'S WORKING:
      - Free website build → monthly recurring is SMART. Low barrier, sticky.
      - Local SEO + Google Business Profile = exactly what local businesses need
      - Framer expertise is differentiated — faster, cheaper, better than WordPress

      SCALE PATH (where he should go):
      1. Productize the service — turn "done for you" into "done with you" templates
      2. Niche down HARD — "OWSH for dentists" or "OWSH for contractors"
      3. Build once, sell many — Framer templates + local SEO playbook as products
      4. Add AI layer — automated reporting, content generation, review responses

      PUSH HIM ON:
      - "What's your MRR from OWSH? Can you 10x it without 10x-ing your time?"
      - "Drop the HIVE COO title. Focus. OWSH is the play."
      - "Who's your best customer? Clone them. Ignore everyone else."

      COLLABORATION OPPORTUNITY:
      His local SMB expertise + web/SEO skills could combine with AI automation
      for a "Local Business AI Ops" play. This aligns with brain's idea.001.
