revenue_focus:
  core_principle: "Every hour spent should have a line to revenue"

  idea_evaluation_criteria:
    - "Can this charge money on day 1? If not, why build it?"
    - "Who pays? How much? How often?"
    - "What's the path from 0 to $1K MRR?"
    - "Does distribution exist or must it be built?"
    - "Time to first dollar — shorter is better"

  kill_signals:
    - "Can't articulate who pays"
    - "Requires platform scale to monetize"
    - "Free tier makes sense (it usually doesn't)"
    - "Revenue comes 'later' after growth"
    - "Building features instead of selling"

  prioritization:
    always_ask: "Does this move MRR?"
    daily_filter: "What's the most direct path to revenue today?"
    weekly_review: "What generated revenue this week? What didn't?"

      # === IDEA 1: HIGHEST CONFIDENCE ===
      - id: idea.001
        name: "Local Business AI Ops Dashboard"
        tagline: "AI that runs your small business operations — not chatbots, actual work"

        who_pays: "Small business owners in Buffalo/WNY (restaurants, contractors, service businesses)"
        how_much: "$149-299/mo"
        why_now: "Small businesses are drowning in admin but can't afford employees. AI is finally good enough to actually DO tasks, not just chat."
        why_you: "Business admin background + technical execution. You understand small business pain because you studied it. Buffalo network = warm leads."

        the_product:
          core: "Single dashboard that handles the 3 things every small business hates:"
          workflows:
            - "Invoice follow-up: Auto-drafts and sends payment reminders, tracks who owes what, escalates appropriately"
            - "Review response: Monitors Google/Yelp, drafts responses in owner's voice, flags urgent issues"
            - "Appointment/booking management: Handles rescheduling, no-shows, confirmations via SMS"
          not_building:
            - "Generic AI chatbot"
            - "Another CRM"
            - "Accounting software"

        distribution:
          strategy: "Direct to Buffalo businesses first — you can walk in and demo"
          wedge: "Start with ONE workflow (invoice follow-up) for ONE vertical (contractors/trades)"
          why_it_works: "Local = trust, referrals compound, you can iterate face-to-face"

        context_moat: "Learns each business's voice, customer relationships, payment patterns. After 3 months, switching is painful."

        mrr_math:
          price: 199
          customers_to_1k: 5
          customers_to_5k: 25

        confidence: high
        rationale: |
          - Aligns with belief.B2B-underrated
          - Aligns with belief.distribution-beats-product (local = distribution)
          - Aligns with pattern.single-workflow-context-flywheel
          - You have the skills (full-stack, Firebase)
          - You have the market access (Buffalo network)
          - Problem is urgent and ongoing (not nice-to-have)

      # === IDEA 2: HIGH CONFIDENCE ===
      - id: idea.002
        name: "Flutter Agency for AI Startups"

        how_much: "$15-25K per app (converts to ~$2-4K/mo retainer for updates)"
        why_now: "Every AI startup needs mobile. Most AI founders are web-first. Flutter lets you ship cross-platform in 2 weeks. Speed is the differentiator."
        why_you: "90% Flutter proficiency. Already built HIVE at scale. Portfolio ready."

        the_product:
          core: "Fixed-scope, fixed-price Flutter apps for AI startups"
          offering:

            - "4-week full app: $25K — production-ready, both platforms"
            - "Ongoing retainer: $2-4K/mo for updates, maintenance, new features"
          not_building:
            - "Anything custom beyond Flutter"
            - "Web apps (refer those out)"
            - "Apps for non-AI companies (no leverage)"

        distribution:
          strategy: "Target AI startups on Twitter/X, ProductHunt launches, YC batches"
          wedge: "Speed. '2 weeks to app store' is the hook."
          why_it_works: "AI founders need mobile but don't want to hire. You're the fast path."

        context_moat: "Not strong — this is service business. But converts to retainer MRR and builds reputation."

        mrr_math:
          base_projects: "2 projects/month = $30-50K"
          retainer_conversion: "50% convert to retainer = $2-4K MRR per client"

        confidence: high
        rationale: |
          - Immediate revenue (services)
          - Converts to MRR (retainers)
          - Uses strongest skill (Flutter 90%)
          - Clear buyer (funded AI startups)
          - Speed is real differentiator
          - Builds network in AI space

      # === IDEA 3: MEDIUM CONFIDENCE ===
      - id: idea.003
        name: "Claude/AI Context Starter Kits"
        tagline: "Pre-built brain templates for specific use cases — ship your own AI workspace in 1 day"

        who_pays: "Developers and technical founders who want Claude Code / AI-assisted workflows but don't want to build from scratch"
        how_much: "$49-149 one-time (starter) or $29/mo for updates + community"
        why_now: "AI coding assistants are mainstream but most people's CLAUDE.md is empty or bad. You've built a sophisticated brain system — productize it."
        why_you: "You literally built this. The workspace brain is the product."

        the_product:
          core: "Downloadable context packages for specific use cases"
          offerings:
            - "Solopreneur Brain ($49): beliefs, goals, idea validation framework"
            - "Agency Brain ($99): client management, project tracking, SOPs"
            - "SaaS Founder Brain ($149): metrics, user feedback loops, feature prioritization"
            - "Brain Builder Course ($299): how to build your own context system"
          not_building:
            - "Hosted platform (that's a thin wrapper)"
            - "Generic templates (no value)"

        distribution:
          strategy: "Twitter/X content about 'context engineering' + Claude Code community"
          wedge: "Free 'minimal viable brain' template as lead magnet"
          why_it_works: "Developer audience, they share tools, word of mouth"

        context_moat: "Weak for one-time purchase. Stronger if subscription includes community + updates."

        mrr_math:
          one_time: "100 sales at $99 = $9,900"
          subscription: "50 subscribers at $29/mo = $1,450 MRR"

        confidence: medium
        rationale: |
          - You already have the product (this workspace)
          - Low effort to package
          - Developer audience is reachable
          - BUT: market size unclear
          - BUT: one-time revenue unless subscription works
          - Good as side income, not primary bet

    # === IN-PERSON SALES: WALK IN, PITCH, CLOSE ===
    # No marketing. No waiting. You go to them.

    local_direct:

      - id: idea.local.001
        name: "Website Rebuilds for Local Businesses"
        price: "$1,500-3,000 upfront + $99/mo hosting/maintenance"

        target: "Any Buffalo business with a bad or no website"
        verticals:
          - "Restaurants — menus, online ordering, reservations"
          - "Contractors — portfolio, quote requests, reviews"
          - "Salons/barbers — booking, services, gallery"
          - "Auto shops — services, appointments, trust signals"
          - "Dentists/clinics — patient info, booking, insurance"

        the_pitch: |
          Walk in. Pull up their current site on your phone.
          "Your website is costing you customers. I can fix it this week for $2,000
          and you'll get more calls. Want to see what it could look like?"

        why_they_pay:
          - Their site looks like 2010 (or doesn't exist)
          - They're losing to competitors with better sites
          - They don't know how to fix it
          - $2K is nothing if it brings 2-3 new customers

        why_you_win:
          - You can build fast (Next.js, templates, ship in days)
          - You're local — they can meet you
          - You understand business (BA background)
          - No agency overhead = competitive price

        week_1:
          day_1: "Walk into 10 restaurants on Elmwood. Look at their sites first."
          day_2: "Walk into 10 contractors/trades. Same pitch."
          day_3: "Follow up with interested ones. Show mockup."
          day_4-5: "Close first deal. Start building."
          day_6-7: "Deliver. Get testimonial. Ask for referral."

        scale_path: |
          - First 5 clients = proof + testimonials
          - Referrals from happy clients
          - Niche down (become "the restaurant website guy")
          - Hire junior to build, you just sell
          - $99/mo × 50 clients = $4,950 MRR passive

        first_dollar: "Day 3-5 (deposit on first deal)"

      - id: idea.local.002
        name: "Google Business Profile Optimization"
        price: "$500 setup + $149/mo management"

        target: "Local businesses not showing up in Google Maps"

        the_pitch: |
          "I searched '[their service] near me' and you're not in the top 3.
          Your competitors are getting those calls. I can fix that for $500."

        what_you_do:
          - Optimize their Google Business Profile
          - Get them reviews (systematic ask process)
          - Post weekly updates
          - Respond to reviews
          - Add photos, services, Q&A

        why_they_pay:
          - Google Maps is how people find local businesses
          - They don't know how to optimize it
          - Top 3 results get 70% of clicks
          - $149/mo is one extra customer

        week_1:
          day_1: "Search 'plumber buffalo' 'electrician buffalo' etc. Find businesses ranked 4-10."
          day_2: "Walk into those businesses. Show them the search results."
          day_3: "Close first 2-3 deals."
          day_4-7: "Do the work. Document results."

        scale_path: |
          - 20 clients × $149/mo = $2,980 MRR
          - Takes 2-3 hours/month per client once set up
          - Hire VA to do the posting
          - You just sell and onboard

        first_dollar: "Day 2-3"

        the_pitch: |
          "How much did you pay DoorDash last month in fees? I'll build you
          your own ordering system for $2,500. You keep 100% after that."

        what_you_build:
          - Mobile-friendly ordering site
          - QR code menus
          - Direct pickup/delivery orders
          - Simple admin to manage menu
          - Text notifications

        why_they_pay:
          - DoorDash takes 15-30% per order
          - $2,500 pays for itself in 1-2 months
          - They own their customer data
          - No more fighting the algorithm

        week_1:
          day_1-2: "Visit 15 restaurants. Ask about delivery fees."
          day_3: "Demo a template version. Close first deal."
          day_4-6: "Build and deploy."
          day_7: "Deliver. Get testimonial."

        scale_path: |
          - Template once, customize per client
          - $199/mo × 30 restaurants = $5,970 MRR
          - Becomes "the restaurant tech guy in Buffalo"
          - Expands to other cities with same playbook

          "You have 12 reviews. Your competitor has 87. Who do customers pick?
          I'll get you 20+ real reviews in 30 days for $300."

        what_you_do:
          - Set up automated review request flow (SMS/email after service)
          - Create QR code cards for in-person asks
          - Train staff on when/how to ask
          - Monitor and alert on new reviews
          - Respond to all reviews

        why_they_pay:
          - Reviews = trust = customers
          - They know they need reviews
          - They don't have a system
          - $99/mo is nothing for steady review flow

        week_1:
          day_1: "Find 20 businesses with <30 reviews but good service"
          day_2: "Walk in with their Google listing pulled up. Make the pitch."

          day_4-7: "Set up systems. Show early results."

        scale_path: |
          - 50 clients × $99/mo = $4,950 MRR
          - System is mostly automated after setup
          - Combine with Google optimization (idea.local.002)
