# Judgments Registry
# Formal opinions rendered on specific targets

# Judgment structure:
# - target: what was evaluated
# - stance: overall position (bullish, skeptical, neutral, bearish, uncertain)
# - tangible_qualities: concrete findings (the point of judgment)
# - unresolved: what couldn't be determined
# - frameworks_used: which beliefs/principles drove the judgment
# - outcome: filled in later when reality reveals if judgment was correct

judgments:

  - id: judgment.001
    target: thread.puckcast
    target_type: thread
    date: "2024-12-06"
    context: "Evaluated NHL prediction product claiming 60% accuracy"

    stance: skeptical
    stance_confidence: tentative

    tangible_qualities:
      - id: tq.001.1
        quality: "accuracy-vs-vig gap"
        finding: "60% accuracy sounds impressive but sportsbooks take ~5% vig. Need 52.4% just to break even. Real metric is ROI after vig, not raw accuracy."
        significance: high

      - id: tq.001.2
        quality: "distribution timing problem"
        finding: "Prediction products must reach users before they bet. No clear distribution strategy = predictions never seen in time."
        significance: high

      - id: tq.001.3
        quality: "niche paradox"
        finding: "NHL is niche within niche (smaller than NFL/NBA). Could mean less competition OR limited TAM. Must pick one framing and commit."
        significance: medium

      - id: tq.001.4
        quality: "context flywheel absence"
        finding: "Product doesn't accumulate context through use. Each prediction is independent. No moat building."
        significance: high

    unresolved:
      - "Community/identity angle not explored — could the real product be belonging, not predictions?"
      - "B2B pivot not evaluated — selling data to sportsbooks rather than consumers?"
      - "Actual ROI after vig not calculated — would change skepticism if positive"

    frameworks_used:
      - belief.distribution-beats-product
      - belief.context-is-moat

  - id: judgment.002
    target: codebase.hive
    target_type: codebase
    date: "2024-12-07"
    context: "First external codebase analysis. HIVE is a multi-tenant campus platform with HiveLab (visual tool builder with AI assist)."

    stance: cautiously-optimistic
    stance_confidence: tentative

    tangible_qualities:
      - id: tq.002.1
        quality: "context accumulation (real)"
        finding: "ContextRetrieverService implements RAG with Firestore vector search. Embeds successful generations, retrieves similar ones for few-shot learning. Actual context flywheel, not storage."
        significance: high

      - id: tq.002.2
        quality: "AI as copilot, not core"
        finding: "Cursor for Visual Tools positioning. Users can drag-drop manually; AI is Cmd+K assist. Doesn't depend on brittle agents."
        significance: high

      - id: tq.002.3
        quality: "built-in distribution"
        finding: "B2B2C campus model. Sell to university → captive audience. Space leaders create tools for spaces. Distribution is structural."
        significance: high

      - id: tq.002.4
        quality: "architectural discipline"
        finding: "DDD bounded contexts, monorepo with clean package boundaries, 14 E2E test files, quality gates for AI generation."
        significance: medium

      - id: tq.002.5
        quality: "platform ambition (risk)"
        finding: "3 apps, 12 packages, 27 element types, 400+ spaces. Not a wedge — a platform bet. Risk of scope killing velocity."
        significance: medium

    unresolved:
      - "Campus pipeline unknown — how many signed vs piloting?"
      - "Team size vs scope mismatch risk"
      - "Revenue model not validated — per-campus SaaS? Usage-based?"
      - "Founder-market fit for campus vertical"

# === META ===

meta:
  purpose: |
    Judgments are formal opinions. Not every exploration becomes one.
    The point is to find tangible qualities in ambiguous things —
    to turn "interesting" into "has X, lacks Y, depends on Z."

    Tracking outcomes over time reveals:
    - Is the brain's judgment improving?
    - Which frameworks lead to correct calls?
    - Where is the brain overconfident?

  trigger: |
    Judgments are created via /judge [target] command.
    This ensures deliberate evaluation, not casual exploration.

  quality_criteria: |
    A good judgment:
    - Finds at least 2-3 tangible qualities
    - Acknowledges what couldn't be resolved
    - References specific frameworks used
    - Takes a stance (even if uncertain)
