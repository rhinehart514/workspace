# === META ===

meta:
  purpose: |
    Predictions make beliefs accountable. If the brain believes something,
    it should be willing to bet on observable outcomes.

    Over time, calibration score reveals:
    - Is the brain's confidence justified?
    - Which domains is it well-calibrated vs overconfident?
    - Are tentative beliefs appropriately uncertain?

  criteria: |
    Good predictions are:
    - Falsifiable: clear conditions for true/false
    - Time-bound: specific check date
    - Observable: can verify without subjective interpretation
    - Non-trivial: outcome isn't obvious

  process: |
    1. Predictions emerge from reasoning chains
    2. Check dates trigger review
    3. Outcomes are recorded with evidence
    4. Calibration score updates
    5. Systematic over/under-confidence surfaces
