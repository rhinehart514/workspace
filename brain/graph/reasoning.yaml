# === META ===

meta:
  purpose: |
    Reasoning chains make beliefs attackable. Every conclusion has a path.
    Paths can be challenged at any step. Predictions make chains falsifiable.
    This is how confidence should move — based on which chain steps survive.

  usage: |
    - When exploring a belief, trace its chain
    - When finding counter-evidence, target specific vulnerabilities
    - When predictions resolve, update chain confidence
    - When chains break, flag for revision

  evolution: |
    Chains should grow as understanding deepens:
    - New evidence strengthens or weakens steps
    - New vulnerabilities get discovered
    - Predictions get resolved
    - Broken chains get marked, not deleted
