# Project: Context Library (This System)
# The brain that tracks itself

project:
  name: "Context Library"
  id: "project.context-library"
  path: "/Users/laneyfraass/prompts"
  repo: null
  status: active

purpose:
  one_liner: "Infrastructure for externalized cognition — a persistent, compounding, queryable version of a human mind"
  thread: thread.saas-futures

  problem: "Knowledge and thinking don't persist between AI sessions. Every conversation starts from zero."
  for_whom: "Initially me. Eventually anyone who wants a personal AGI."

  moat_type: context
  moat_notes: "The system accumulates beliefs, predictions, judgments, and calibration data through use. Each session makes it more valuable."

decisions:

  - id: decision.001
    date: "2024-12-06"
    what: "YAML for graph, Markdown for prose"
    why: "YAML is machine-readable for future tooling. Markdown is human-readable for context loading."
    alternatives_considered: ["All JSON", "All Markdown", "Database"]
    revisit_if: "Graph becomes too large for file-based approach"

  - id: decision.002
    date: "2024-12-06"
    what: "Confidence levels: speculative → tentative → grounded → hardened"
    why: "Beliefs need gradations. Can't just be true/false. The system should know what it knows."
    alternatives_considered: ["Binary confidence", "Numeric scores"]
    revisit_if: "Calibration data shows these buckets aren't useful"

  - id: decision.003
    date: "2024-12-09"
    what: "Load-bearing CLAUDE.md — beliefs/vocab/threads embedded directly"
    why: "System should BE the context, not describe how to load context. Every session starts with knowledge already present."
    alternatives_considered: ["Keep separate files with load commands"]
    revisit_if: "CLAUDE.md becomes too long and causes context issues"

  - id: decision.004
    date: "2024-12-09"
    what: "Proactive agenda — brain drives session, not user"
    why: "Reactive systems wait. Proactive systems think. The brain should have opinions about what matters."
    alternatives_considered: ["Keep reactive with slash commands"]
    revisit_if: "Proactive mode becomes annoying rather than useful"

conventions:
  language: "YAML, Markdown"
  framework: "None — file-based knowledge system"

  current_focus: "Making the brain proactive and code-aware"
  blocked_on: []
  next_actions:
    - "Create codebase evaluation protocol"
    - "Create tool registry"
    - "Add thread momentum tracking"
    - "Test proactive agenda in next session"

evaluation:
  judgment_id: null  # Haven't formally judged ourselves yet

  checks:
    real_problem: true
    structural_advantage: true  # Context accumulation
    clear_value_capture: unclear  # Not monetizing, personal use
    ai_load_bearing: true

  concerns:
    - "Complexity might be procrastination"
    - "System could become maintenance burden"
    - "Beliefs might not actually improve decisions"

  strengths:
    - "Recursive — the system helps think about itself"
    - "Context moat is real — already valuable after 6 sessions"
    - "Predictions create accountability"
