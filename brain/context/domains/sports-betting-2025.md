# Sports Betting Market 2025

## Market Size & Growth

The sports betting market is massive and accelerating:
- **$155B → $257B** projected growth 2025-2030 (10.5% CAGR)
- **US online gambling** projected to reach $52.6B by 2033
- **2024 US legal wagers:** $147B (23% increase from 2023)
- **2025 Super Bowl alone:** $1.39B in legal wagers (record)

## Legalization Status

- **38 states** now have legal sports betting (as of Nov 2025)
- **Missouri** joins December 2025
- **11 holdouts:** Alabama, Alaska, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah
- Regulatory landscape remains fragmented state-by-state

## Where Value Accrues

### The Players
1. **Sportsbooks** (DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM) — Take the vig, own the customer relationship
2. **Data providers** — Sell feeds to books and media
3. **Media/affiliates** — Acquire customers for books, take referral fees
4. **Prediction/tips services** — Sell edge (or claimed edge) to bettors

### Structural Reality
- **Live betting = 59.58%** of online betting market. Real-time data is the game.
- **Football = 36.58%** of market share (NHL is smaller, niche)
- **Mobile-first:** Online segment growing at 12.9% CAGR

## AI in Sports Betting

**What's happening:**
- Machine learning for real-time predictions (weather, player stats, sentiment)
- AI personalization increasing customer loyalty and betting frequency
- New entrants like SportsBetting.Ai launching AI-powered tools

**Reality check:**
- Sportsbooks use AI too — lines are increasingly efficient
- Public models struggle to consistently beat closing lines
- Edge erodes quickly as market incorporates information

## Tensions in the Market

**Sharp vs. casual bettors:**
- Sharps want edge, data, transparency
- Casuals want entertainment, social proof, simplicity
- Same prediction product can't serve both well

**Prediction markets vs. sports betting:**
- Platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket face regulatory pressure
- States issuing cease-and-desist letters
- Blurry line between "prediction" and "gambling"

**Accuracy vs. vig:**
- A 60% accurate model sounds good
- But sportsbooks take ~5% juice
- Need consistent edge AFTER vig to profit
- Many "winning" systems lose money net of juice

## Implications for Puckcast

**Opportunity:**
- NHL is niche but dedicated audience
- Less competition than NFL/NBA prediction space
- Calibrated probabilities with transparency could differentiate

**Challenges:**
- 60% accuracy may not beat the vig consistently
- Competing against sharp lines set by sophisticated books
- Seasonality: Oct-June only, dead in summer
- Distribution: How to reach bettors before they've already bet?

**Strategic questions:**
- Is this a B2C bettor product or B2B data product?
- Can you prove ROI after vig, not just accuracy?
- What's the wedge against free ESPN/Athletic predictions?
