# AI Landscape 2024-2025: What's Actually Working

## The Small Team Revolution

The old model: $100M ARR required 500+ employees.
The new model: AI-native companies reaching that with <100 people.

### Specific Examples (Real Numbers)

| Company | ARR | Team Size | Time to ARR | Category |
|---------|-----|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Cursor (Anysphere) | $100M | 20 | 21 months | Dev tools |
| Midjourney | $200M | 10 | 2 years | Image generation |
| ElevenLabs | $100M | 50 | 2 years | Voice AI |
| Bolt (StackBlitz) | $20M | 15 | 2 months | Dev tools |
| Lovable | $17M | 15 | 3 months | Dev tools |
| Mercor | $50M | 30 | 2 years | HR/recruiting |
| Aragon.ai | $10M | 9 | 2 years | Headshot generation |

### Even Smaller: Solo/Micro Founders
- **BuiltWith:** $14M/year, 1 employee
- **Testimonial:** $1.5M ARR, solo founder
- **Seats.aero:** $1.5M ARR, solo founder

Sam Altman prediction: "First one-person billion-dollar company" is coming.

## What Categories Are Working

### 1. Developer Tools (Hottest)
- AI coding assistants (Cursor, Copilot, Cody)
- AI-powered IDEs and dev environments
- Code review, testing, documentation automation
- **Why it works:** Developers adopt fast, pay for productivity, word-of-mouth distribution

### 2. Vertical AI (Rising)
- Specific industry solutions (healthcare, legal, finance)
- Vertical winners captured >$1B combined funding in 2025 YTD
- **Why it works:** Deep domain = harder to replicate, clearer ROI, can charge more

### 3. Creative Tools
- Image generation (Midjourney, DALL-E)
- Voice cloning (ElevenLabs)
- Video generation (Runway, Pika)
- **Why it works:** Visible output, viral potential, prosumer willingness to pay

### 4. Automation/Workflow
- Customer service bots (saved 2.5B hours in 2024)
- Document processing, data extraction
- Scheduling, email, admin tasks
- **Why it works:** Clear cost savings, easy ROI calculation

## Funding Landscape

- **$170B+** to AI companies since start of 2024
- **62% increase** YoY in AI startup funding
- But: Most goes to giants (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Small teams are bootstrapping or raising modest seed rounds

## What's NOT Working

- **Thin wrappers:** ChatGPT UI with a niche skin = no moat
- **"AI for everything":** Unfocused, can't nail any use case
- **Enterprise sales with small teams:** Takes too long, burns cash
- **Consumer apps without viral loop:** CAC too high

## Patterns From Winners

1. **Extreme focus:** One use case, one user type, nail it
2. **Usage-based or seat-based pricing:** Aligns value with revenue
3. **Developer/prosumer first:** They adopt fast, tolerate rough edges
4. **Distribution built into product:** Output is shareable, invites others
5. **Fast iteration:** Ship weekly, not quarterly

## Implications for Evaluating AI Products

**Questions to ask:**
- Is the team right-sized for the opportunity?
- Is there a path to $1M ARR with <10 people?
- Does usage compound (context flywheel) or is each session standalone?
- Can distribution happen through the product itself?
- Is this a wrapper or does it create new capability?
