# Distribution Channels 2025: What's Actually Working

## The Big Shift: Social SEO

**2024:** People realized TikTok and Instagram are search engines.
**2025:** "Social SEO" went mainstream.

What this means:
- Posts need to be **searchable inside platforms**
- Captions, on-screen text, hashtags, alt text all feed the algorithm's indexing
- For short-form video: keywords in **first 3-5 seconds** of audio/captions matter more than hashtags at end
- Reddit, TikTok, YouTube comments are the new front page of search

**Community is the new SEO.** Brand narratives need to be seeded, shared, and searchable across social platforms, not just Google.

## Channel Hierarchy (By ROI)

### Tier 1: Owned Channels (Highest ROI)
1. **Email lists** — Still the highest ROI channel in digital
2. **Communities you control** — Slack, Discord, private forums
3. **SMS subscribers** — Works surprisingly well for DTC

The play: Use social to spark attention → funnel to owned space → nurture.

Example: Short TikTok tip → CTA to free checklist → email capture → nurture sequence.

### Tier 2: Social Platforms
- **Private spaces growing faster** — DMs, group chats, Discord (+25% YoY)
- **Micro-influencers (2K-25K followers)** — 60% higher engagement than big accounts
- **Short-form video** — 3x more engagement than long-form

Algorithm reality: Engagement > follower count. Smaller engaged audience > large passive following.

### Tier 3: Traditional Inbound
- **SEO/content** — Works if you're solving a problem people search for
- **Product-led growth** — Works for simple self-serve products
- **Direct sales** — Necessary for complex/expensive, but expensive for small teams

## Channel Selection Framework

**Bullseye Framework:**
1. Brainstorm every possible channel
2. Test 2-3 most promising on small scale
3. Double down on what shows traction

**One channel, one job.** Don't ask each channel to do five things. Assign a single purpose:
- Awareness channel (reach)
- Engagement channel (conversation)
- Conversion channel (sign-up/purchase)
- Retention channel (community)

## What's NOT Working

- **Buying followers/impressions** — Algorithms punish low engagement
- **Long-form content without search intent** — Gets buried
- **Pure SEO without social signals** — Search engines now incorporate social
- **Broad influencer campaigns** — Expensive, low conversion
- **Spray-and-pray posting** — Algorithms reward consistency + engagement, not volume

## Platform-Specific Notes

**TikTok/Reels/Shorts:**
- Best for awareness, terrible for conversion
- Hook in first 1 second
- Keywords in audio matter for search

**Twitter/X:**
- Good for B2B, thought leadership
- Threads > single tweets for reach
- Algorithm favors replies and conversation

**LinkedIn:**
- Highest organic reach of major platforms
- Works for B2B, professional services
- Personal > company pages

**Discord/Slack:**
- Community building, retention
- Requires active moderation
- Works for technical audiences

**Email:**
- Conversion and retention
- Needs lead magnet to grow
- Consistency > frequency

## For Prediction/Content Products Specifically

**Challenge:** Your product is content that gets consumed and forgotten.

**What works:**
- Daily/weekly ritual (habit formation)
- Shareable format (predictions as images for social)
- Proof of performance (track record builds trust)
- Community discussion (Discord where users discuss picks)
- Email as anchor (daily predictions email, can't miss it)

**Distribution flywheel for predictions:**
1. Prediction → social post → engagement
2. Good calls → screenshot and share → social proof
3. Track record → email signup → daily habit
4. Community discussion → retention → word of mouth
