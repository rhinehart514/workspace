# Vocabulary

Terms and concepts used in specific ways across this workspace. Add definitions here so LLMs understand your shorthand.

---

## Market & Strategy Terms

<!-- entity: term.thin-wrapper | confidence: grounded -->
**Thin wrapper**
A product that's just a UI layer over an API with no accumulated value. Pejorative — implies easy to replicate.

<!-- entity: term.context-moat | confidence: grounded -->
**Context moat**
Defensibility that comes from accumulated knowledge, user data, or workflow integration rather than code complexity.

<!-- entity: term.capability-compression | confidence: grounded -->
**Capability compression**
When something that required a product becomes an API call or prompt.

<!-- entity: term.wedge | confidence: grounded -->
**Wedge**
The initial entry point into a market. The narrow, focused use case you start with before expanding.

---

## AI & Technical Terms

<!-- entity: term.context-engineering | confidence: grounded -->
**Context engineering**
The practice of structuring information so LLMs can use it effectively. Includes prompt design, context loading, and knowledge organization.

<!-- entity: term.context-window | confidence: grounded -->
**Context window**
The amount of text an LLM can process in a single session. Measured in tokens.

<!-- entity: term.agentic | confidence: grounded -->
**Agentic**
AI systems that take actions autonomously rather than just generating text. Implies multi-step execution.

<!-- entity: term.wrapper | confidence: grounded -->
**Wrapper**
A product built on top of an AI API. Can be thin (little added value) or thick (significant workflow integration).

---

## Product & Building Terms

<!-- entity: term.validation | confidence: grounded -->
**Validation**
Testing whether an idea works with real users before full build.

<!-- entity: term.first-version-thinking | confidence: grounded -->
**First-version thinking**
Designing the smallest thing you can build that tests the core hypothesis.

<!-- entity: term.load-bearing | confidence: grounded -->
**Load-bearing**
A component that's essential to function. "AI is load-bearing" means remove it and the product breaks.

---

## Economic Structure Terms

<!-- entity: term.barbell-economy | confidence: grounded -->
**Barbell economy**
The thesis that the economy bifurcates into giant platforms on one end and tiny operators on the other, with the middle hollowing out. Often overstated—see belief.middle-restructures.

<!-- entity: term.translation-layer-business | confidence: tentative -->
**Translation layer business**
A business that bridges the gap between "AI exists" and "my business uses AI well" for a specific vertical. Examples: "AI implementation for plumbers," "tech stack management for insurance agencies."

<!-- entity: term.ai-native-micro-corp | confidence: tentative -->
**AI-native micro-corp**
1-3 humans with significant AI leverage, achieving high revenue per employee ($500K-$2M+). Often operates in niches too small for venture but now economically viable due to AI cost structure.

## Add Your Own

As you develop concepts and terminology, add them here. The goal is to build a shared vocabulary that persists across sessions.

*Format: **Term** — Definition. Keep definitions concise.*
