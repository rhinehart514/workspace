# Beliefs

These are subjective positions. Not observations about the market — opinions about what matters, what works, what's overrated, what's underrated. They're meant to be opinionated and revisable.

The point of writing beliefs down is to make them available for challenge. If a belief survives repeated contact with reality, it hardens into conviction. If it doesn't, it gets revised or dropped.

## On Building

<!-- entity: belief.small-is-underrated | confidence: tentative -->
**Small is underrated.** The instinct to build big is usually wrong. The best version of most ideas is smaller than the first vision. Scope kills more projects than competition does.

<!-- entity: belief.speed-matters | confidence: tentative -->
**Speed matters more than most people admit.** Not recklessness — but the cost of delay is almost always higher than the cost of imperfection. Ship, learn, adjust.

<!-- entity: belief.infrastructure-procrastination | confidence: tentative -->
**Most "infrastructure" is procrastination.** Building systems to support work that doesn't exist yet. The work comes first; the systems follow.

<!-- entity: belief.taste-is-learnable | confidence: tentative -->
**Taste is real and learnable.** Good judgment about what to build isn't mystical. It's pattern recognition that develops through exposure and reflection.

## On AI

<!-- entity: belief.ai-pressures-judgment | confidence: tentative -->
**AI doesn't replace judgment, it pressures it.** When generation is cheap, knowing what to generate becomes the bottleneck. Curation and taste become more valuable, not less.

<!-- entity: belief.context-is-moat | confidence: tentative -->
**Context is the moat people aren't building.** Everyone's building wrappers. Few are building knowledge systems that accumulate value over time. The latter is harder and more defensible.

<!-- entity: belief.ai-powered-meaningless | confidence: tentative -->
**"AI-powered" is already meaningless.** It's table stakes. The question isn't whether something uses AI — it's what the AI specifically enables that wasn't possible before.

<!-- entity: belief.agents-timing | confidence: tentative -->
**Agents are overhyped in the short term, underhyped in the long term.** Current agent architectures are brittle. But the trajectory toward autonomous execution is real. The timing is the hard part.

## On Markets

<!-- entity: belief.markets-smaller | confidence: tentative -->
**Most markets are smaller than they look.** The addressable market is not the market you'll address. Realistic wedges are narrower than pitch decks suggest.

<!-- entity: belief.distribution-beats-product | confidence: tentative -->
**Distribution beats product, usually.** A mediocre product with great distribution wins over a great product with no distribution. This is frustrating but true.

<!-- entity: belief.b2b-underrated | confidence: tentative -->
**B2B is underrated by technical founders.** Consumer is sexier. B2B pays the bills. Businesses have budgets and buying processes; consumers have whims and app fatigue.

<!-- entity: belief.ai-eats-x-lazy | confidence: tentative -->
**The "AI will eat X" framing is lazy.** It doesn't tell you what specifically changes, for whom, or why they'd pay. It's vibes, not analysis.

<!-- entity: belief.middle-restructures | confidence: tentative -->
**The middle restructures, it doesn't disappear.** The barbell economy thesis is too simple. Mid-size businesses don't vanish—they get leaner. Revenue-per-employee rises. A company that needed 40 people runs on 15.

<!-- entity: belief.local-physical-premium | confidence: tentative -->
**Local and physical gain relative value.** As digital services commoditize, services requiring physical presence or trust gain pricing power. "Human-touched" becomes a signal in some markets.

## On Process

<!-- entity: belief.user-conversations-cheat | confidence: tentative -->
**Talking to users is the cheat code.** Most builders avoid it because it's uncomfortable. Those who do it consistently have an unfair advantage.

<!-- entity: belief.writing-clarifies | confidence: grounded -->
**Writing clarifies thinking.** If you can't write it down clearly, you don't understand it. The act of writing is the thinking, not just the output.

<!-- entity: belief.optionality-cost | confidence: tentative -->
**Optionality has a cost.** Keeping options open feels safe but delays learning. Sometimes the right move is to commit and find out.

*These should be argued with. When experience contradicts a belief, update the belief or note the exception.*
