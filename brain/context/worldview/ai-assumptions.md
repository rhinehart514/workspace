# AI Assumptions

## Working Beliefs

These are assumptions that shape how we think about building. They're not predictions — they're premises we operate from until evidence changes them.

### Capability Trajectory
- Models will continue improving rapidly in reasoning, context handling, and multimodal understanding
- Cost per token will continue dropping
- Latency will decrease, enabling more real-time applications
- Context windows will expand, reducing the need for complex retrieval architectures

### What AI Does Well (Now)
- Generating first drafts of nearly anything
- Pattern matching across large information spaces
- Translation between formats, styles, domains
- Explaining and summarizing
- Brainstorming and ideation support

### What AI Still Struggles With
- Maintaining consistency across very long tasks
- Genuine novelty (vs. recombination)
- Knowing what it doesn't know
- Persistent memory and learning within a session
- Reliable execution of multi-step plans without supervision

### Structural Implications
- Human-AI collaboration > full automation for complex work
- Context engineering becomes a core skill
- Products that "wrap" AI need defensibility beyond the wrapper
- The bottleneck shifts from generation to judgment and curation

### What We're Watching
- Agent architectures and their reliability
- Memory and personalization systems
- Cost curves for inference
- Enterprise adoption patterns
