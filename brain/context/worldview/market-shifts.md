# Market Shifts

## The Current Transition

The market is in a structural transition driven by AI capabilities. This isn't a feature upgrade to existing software — it's a change in what software is and how value gets captured.

## 2025 Reality Check: What We're Seeing

### The Small Team Revolution
The numbers are real:
- **Cursor:** $100M ARR, 20 people, 21 months
- **Midjourney:** $200M ARR, 10 people, 2 years
- **ElevenLabs:** $100M ARR, 50 people, 2 years
- **Lovable:** $17M ARR, 15 people, 3 months

Old model: $100M ARR = 500+ employees
New model: $100M ARR = <50 people, sometimes <20

### What's Actually Working
1. **Developer tools** — Cursor, Bolt, Lovable. Devs adopt fast, pay for productivity.
2. **Vertical AI** — Domain-specific solutions. Deeper = harder to copy.
3. **Creative tools** — Midjourney, ElevenLabs. Visible output, viral potential.
4. **Automation** — Clear cost savings. Chatbots saved 2.5B hours in 2024.

### What's NOT Working
- **Thin wrappers** — ChatGPT with a UI skin. No moat.
- **"AI for everything"** — Unfocused, can't nail any use case.
- **Enterprise sales with small teams** — Burns cash, takes too long.
- **Consumer apps without viral loop** — CAC too high.

## SaaS Compression (Original Analysis)

Traditional SaaS captured value through:
- Hosting complexity (you couldn't run it yourself)
- Feature accumulation (switching costs via workflow lock-in)
- Seat-based pricing (value scaled with team size)

AI disrupts all three:
- Capabilities become API calls, not hosted products
- Features can be generated on-demand rather than pre-built
- Automation reduces seat count as a value metric

## Distribution Reality 2025

### Social SEO is Real
- TikTok and Instagram are search engines now
- Keywords in first 3-5 seconds of video matter more than hashtags
- Community is the new SEO — Reddit, Discord, YouTube comments

### Channel Hierarchy by ROI
1. **Email lists** — Still highest ROI
2. **Owned communities** — Discord, Slack
3. **Micro-influencers** — 60% higher engagement than big accounts
4. **Short-form video** — 3x engagement vs. long-form

### The Funnel That Works
Social (attention) → Lead magnet → Email capture → Nurture → Convert

Private spaces (DMs, Discord) growing faster than public likes.

## What's Emerging
- **Capability commoditization**: What required a product now requires a prompt
- **Context as moat**: The defensible layer moves from code to accumulated knowledge (but: portable context ≠ moat)
- **Outcome-based value**: Pricing shifts from access to results
- **One-person unicorns**: Sam Altman predicts first billion-dollar solo founder company coming

## Open Questions
- Where does value accumulate when capabilities are cheap?
- What new categories emerge that weren't possible before AI?
- Which existing categories compress to zero vs. transform?
- Can content products build context flywheels, or are they inherently consumable?
