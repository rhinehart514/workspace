## The Question

If traditional SaaS is compressing, what replaces it? Where does software value accumulate in an AI-native world?

---

## Current Thinking

SaaS worked because:
1. Software was hard to build and host
2. Features accumulated into workflow lock-in
3. Per-seat pricing aligned with team-based work

AI disrupts all three. But "SaaS dies" is too simple. More likely:
- Some categories compress to zero (simple tools, utilities)
- Some categories transform (AI becomes core, changes the product shape)
- Some categories emerge (things that weren't possible before)
- Some persist (deep workflow integration, regulated industries, infrastructure)

The question isn't "will there be software companies" — it's "what does the defensible software company look like?"

---

## Evidence & Inputs

- Rapid proliferation of AI wrappers that add little value
- Enterprise still buying traditional SaaS (but with AI features bolted on)
- New category of "AI-native" tools emerging (Cursor, v0, etc.)
- Open source models making self-hosting viable for some use cases

### Exploration: 2024-12-06

**Pattern identified: "Single workflow + context flywheel" as smallest viable model**

The smallest viable AI-native business appears to be: one high-value workflow that accumulates context through use.

Characteristics:
- One workflow, done well (not a platform)
- Context accumulation built-in (each use teaches the product)
- Low marginal cost (API costs << value delivered)
- Distribution through the workflow itself
- Can be built by one person, launched in weeks

Examples that fit:
- AI writing with style learning
- Domain-specific AI that learns terminology
- Personal knowledge management with AI retrieval
- Narrow workflow automation for specific niches

**Counter-evidence found:** Code completion tools (Cursor, Copilot) show that context doesn't always create moat — the context (codebase) is portable, not locked to product. Context moat works when context is genuinely proprietary and accumulates through use, not when user already has it elsewhere.

## Open Questions

- ~~What's the smallest viable AI-native business model?~~ → Explored 2024-12-06. Pattern: "single workflow + context flywheel"
- Does "context moat" actually work, or is it also commoditized eventually?
- Will outcome-based pricing (pay per result) become standard?
- Where do agents fit — and do they replace SaaS or use it?

### New questions from exploration:
- What distinguishes "defensible context" from "portable context"?
- Are there examples of solo-built AI products that reached profitability?
- What's the minimum data accumulation threshold for defensibility?
- Does outcome-based pricing work for small-scale AI products?

---

## Next Steps

- Map categories by compression risk
- Look at what's working for AI-native companies
- Explore outcome-based pricing examples
