# What to Avoid

## Patterns That Don't Work

### Thin Wrappers
Building a UI around an API call. No context accumulation, no workflow integration, no reason users can't do it themselves once they learn the API. These get competed away immediately.

### Feature Hunting
Adding capabilities because they're possible, not because they're needed. Results in bloated products with no clear identity.

### Premature Scaling
Building infrastructure for millions of users before you have hundreds. Solving scaling problems you don't have yet.

### Complexity Theater
Sophisticated architecture that doesn't serve the user. Multiple services, elaborate pipelines, enterprise patterns — when a simple script would work.

### "AI-Powered" Decoration
Slapping AI onto a product that doesn't need it. If the core value isn't AI-dependent, the AI becomes a gimmick.

### Dependency on Model Improvement
"This will work when models get better." If it doesn't work now, don't build it now.

### Crowded Categories Without Differentiation
Entering a space with many competitors and no clear angle. "We'll just do it better" isn't a strategy.

### Long Validation Cycles
Ideas that require months of building before you can test with users. Prefer concepts with fast feedback loops.

### Misaligned Incentives
Business models where your success doesn't align with user success. Engagement farming, artificial friction, value extraction.

## Questions to Pressure-Test

- "What happens when someone copies this?"
- "Why would users stay after the novelty wears off?"
- "What's the version of this that fails?"
- "Am I building for a real user or an imagined one?"
- "Is this solving my problem or their problem?"

*Avoidance criteria are as important as selection criteria.*
