# Product Thinking

## How We Evaluate Ideas

### The Core Question
Does this create value that wouldn't exist without it, in a way that's hard to replicate?

### What Makes Something Worth Building

**Real problem, real urgency**
The problem exists today and people are actively trying to solve it (even if poorly). We don't create demand; we serve unmet demand.

**Structural advantage**
There's a reason this is hard to copy. Possibilities:
- Network effects (more users = more value)
- Data accumulation (usage improves the product)
- Integration depth (switching costs from workflow embedding)
- Expertise moat (domain knowledge that's hard to acquire)
- Speed (first to solve it well enough)

**Clear value capture**
We can explain how money flows. Who pays, why they pay, and why they keep paying.

**Leverage from AI**
AI should be load-bearing, not decorative. If you remove the AI, the product shouldn't work — or should work dramatically worse.

### Signs of a Strong Concept
- You can describe the user and their pain in one sentence
- The first version is buildable in weeks, not months
- There's an obvious way to validate it with real users quickly
- The business model is simple to explain
- It could grow without proportional cost growth

### Signs of a Weak Concept
- The value proposition requires explanation
- It depends on user behavior change
- The AI is a feature, not the engine
- There's no clear wedge (entry point to market)
- Defensibility relies on "we'll just execute better"
