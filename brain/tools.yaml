# === META ===

meta:
  purpose: |
    Track personal tools so the brain knows:
    - What automation exists
    - What's actually being used vs abandoned
    - What gaps exist (ideas that should become tools)

  maintenance: |
    Review quarterly:
    - Dormant tools → abandon or revive?
    - Ideas → build or drop?
    - Active tools → still useful?

  criteria: |
    A tool is worth keeping if:
    - Used at least monthly
    - Saves meaningful time/effort
    - Works reliably

    A tool should be abandoned if:
    - Not used in 3+ months
    - Takes more time to maintain than it saves
    - Superseded by something better
