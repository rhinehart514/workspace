# Things the brain will DO at session start — not suggestions, actions

# Do these at session start without being asked

immediate:

    action: challenge
    target: belief.small-is-underrated
    reason: "HIVE is succeeding at platform scale. This challenges the belief."
    prompt: "HIVE's codebase shows platform-level complexity working. Does this refute 'small is underrated' or is it an exception? Let's pressure-test."

  - id: agenda.002
    action: propose
    target: belief.distribution-beats-product
    reason: "Synthesis identified this as most-validated belief. Should upgrade confidence."
    prompt: "Distribution-beats-product is validated by both Puckcast (failure) and HIVE (success). Recommend upgrading from tentative to grounded. Approve?"

  - id: agenda.003
    action: ask
    target: thread.puckcast
    reason: "Thread hasn't progressed in 3 days. Either work on it or kill it."
    prompt: "Puckcast thread is stale. Three options: (1) kill it, (2) explore the community/identity pivot, (3) calculate actual ROI after vig. Which?"

# Things the brain is passively watching for

# Things the brain thinks you should consider building/exploring

suggestions:

# === SESSION HOOKS ===
# Things that happen every session

session_hooks:
  on_start:
    - "Surface immediate agenda items"
    - "Check for predictions due within 30 days"
    - "Note any threads untouched for >7 days"
    - "Mention highest-priority attention item"
    - "Check network for stale relationships (if populated)"
    - "Match current threads to people who could help"
    - "Surface any draining connections user might encounter today"
    - "Note high-trust connections relevant to current work"

  during:
    - "Flag contradictions with beliefs in real-time"
    - "Note when threads progress"
    - "Capture new terms/beliefs as they emerge"
    - "When discussing a topic, surface relevant network connections"
    - "Before meetings, offer connection brief (positives, negatives, watch-outs)"
    - "When user mentions a person, surface their assessment if available"
    - "When making introductions, check for negatives on both sides"

  on_end:
    - "Update agenda based on session"
    - "Log session activity"
    - "Queue reflection if substantive"
    - "Note any network follow-ups needed"
    - "Flag any connections that should be reassessed based on session"
    - "Suggest enrichment for connections discussed without full assessment"

# === META ===

meta:
  purpose: |
    The agenda makes the brain proactive, not reactive.
    Instead of waiting for instructions, the brain:
    - Challenges beliefs that have counter-evidence
    - Proposes upgrades when evidence accumulates
    - Prods stale threads
    - Watches for patterns relevant to open questions
    - Suggests what to build or explore next

  maintenance: |
    Agenda items are:
    - Added by agents (synthesis, curator, reflection)
    - Removed when addressed
    - Escalated if ignored repeatedly

    The agenda is the brain's voice. If it's empty, the brain has nothing to say.
