# === PROACTIVE SUGGESTIONS ===
# Things the brain thinks you should consider building/exploring
# REVENUE-FIRST: All suggestions filtered through MRR lens

suggestions:

  - id: suggest.mrr.001
    type: validate
    description: "Find 3 ideas with shortest path to $1K MRR"
    rationale: "Revenue is oxygen. No ideas in pipeline = no future revenue. This is the most important task."
    thread: null
    priority: critical
    instructions: |
      For each idea answer:
      1. Who pays? (specific person/role, not 'businesses')
      2. How much? (price point)
      3. How often? (MRR vs one-time)
      4. Why now? (urgency)
      5. Time to first dollar? (days, not months)

  - id: suggest.mrr.002
    type: sell
    description: "Pre-sell before building — get a commitment"
    rationale: "Best validation is someone paying. Can you get a customer to pay before the product exists?"
    thread: null
    priority: critical
    instructions: |
      1. Pick top idea from pipeline
      2. Create simple landing page or pitch
      3. Ask 10 potential customers: 'Would you pay $X for this?'
      4. If yes: 'Great, here's the payment link'
      5. Money talks, everything else walks

  - id: suggest.mrr.003
    type: kill
    description: "Kill Puckcast unless you can name a paying customer"
    rationale: "Sunk cost fallacy is real. Time on Puckcast = time not on something that makes money."

# === META ===

meta:
  purpose: |
    The agenda makes the brain proactive, not reactive.
    Instead of waiting for instructions, the brain:
    - Challenges beliefs that have counter-evidence
    - Proposes upgrades when evidence accumulates
    - Prods stale threads
    - Watches for patterns relevant to open questions
    - Suggests what to build or explore next

  maintenance: |
    Agenda items are:
    - Added by agents (synthesis, curator, reflection)
    - Removed when addressed
    - Escalated if ignored repeatedly

    The agenda is the brain's voice. If it's empty, the brain has nothing to say.
